DESCRIPTION:

Ticket Sales Service is an attempt to rectify the current issues that plague popular ticket selling platforms across the board. Users today find themselves stuck with sky-high fees, bots buying tickets before anyone else, and much more. Our platform is an attempt to help reduce, or even eliminate these issues for a smooth stress-free ticket selling experience, for both users and vendors alike.
